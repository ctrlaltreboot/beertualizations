BEERtualize all the VMs!
========================

### New and improved!

Improved leeching that it. Until recently I haven't been aware of the new developments (they come so fast!) on docker.io.
The structure of this repo has changed from master to multiple branches that would contain individualized dockerfiles per deemed purpose.

What does that mean? It means that the repository branch naming will be like:
`nodejs-master` - This is the branch for nodejs centric (installation and configuration of a container that has nodejs) dockerfile.
`rails-master`  -  ^ see above but for rails.

### Playing around with virtualization when I can.

Right now there are just Dockerfiles in here that I play with using a ~~Linux Mint~~ OSX (Gasp!) machine (yes, I know, I don't have much time to do Arch nowadays... but I digress).

~~Instead of pushing up to the docker registry (and taking up precious resources) is another rationale why I'm doing this.~~

### Am I doing it wrong?
Feel free to copy, modify, or do whatever you like with the stuff here. Leech, suck, whatever, it's all yours!
