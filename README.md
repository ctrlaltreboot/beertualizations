BEERtualize all the VMs!
========================

### Playing around with virtualization when I can.

Right now there are just Dockerfiles in here that I play with using a ~~Linux Mint~~ OSX (Gasp!) machine (yes, I know, I don't have much time to do Arch nowadays... but I digress).
Instead of pushing up to the docker registry (and taking up precious resources) is another rationale why I'm doing this.

### Am I doing it wrong?
Feel free to copy, modify, or do whatever you like with the stuff here. Leech, suck, whatever, it's all yours!
